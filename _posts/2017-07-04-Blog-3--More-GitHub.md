    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>

    <td>In the two lessons I made a lot of progress with my GitHub blog. This was partially due to the incredibly helpful website W3schools. Without this I would have not have been able to complete all the work as many of the things I wanted to implement in my blog, I had forgotten. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was partially limited by having to change tabs to w3schools to implement something new, this was very time consuming as I had to read much of the guide to remember how to do the task outlined in the guide. However this was not the main challenge I faced during the lessons. The biggest challenge I faced was looking at a guide that would improve the aesthetics of my blog substantially then spending 10 minutes reading it, only to find out I had been reading a guide for a different branch of CSS which would not work with my blog.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to limit the time spent on websites trying to find new things to put in my blog, rather I will try to improve the blog with knowledge I can remember to make editing my blog a swifter process, thus increasing the amount of work done during the lesson. I will also always remember to check which language of code the guides that I do look are in before I jump into reading the, to avoid wasting time.</td>
