    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had lots of knowledge however I had lost some of it through the year. Also I am using a different variation of the 'jekyll' format.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>The target for this lesson was to delete and remake our blogs using a different version of the ‘jekyll’ format. Also changing things like background, adding tables and personalising the blog were part of the lesson too.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I partly reached my target. I restarted my blog but only managed to change the title text colour.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As I hadn't done a blog for so long, many of the tasks we were given to complete were far more difficult than when we did them in the previous lessons. Because of this, I spent lots of time trying to remember how to complete such tasks- as my notes on notability had not saved. However I did manage to change features such as text colour and I also managed to change the name and description of the blog.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by the long break from doing anything to my blog, this meant that my coding skills were rusty: such as struggling to remember to put a semicolon at the end of each line and getting confused about speech marks and brackets.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will practice more coding skills on my blog, I will commit to practicing changing background colours and adding a gradient. My text colours will also be changed as well as putting code for a table into my blog. If I finish all of this by the end of the lesson, I will ade a box shadow to my table with my blog in it, this will make my blog more eye catching.</td>
