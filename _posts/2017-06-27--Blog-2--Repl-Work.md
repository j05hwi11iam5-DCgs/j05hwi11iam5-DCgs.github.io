(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I had not used repl for so long, most of it was completely unfamiliar. However after Mr. Keen explained to us how to use it again, I felt more familiar, however this brought us to the end of the lesson so I had to pursue this at home.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by the fact that I had not repl for so long, this meant that whilst I was able to figure out the logic to the problems, it took a much greater quantity of time to carry out my thoughts.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will practice my repl so that I can carry out the problems or other work in a swifter manner.</td>
